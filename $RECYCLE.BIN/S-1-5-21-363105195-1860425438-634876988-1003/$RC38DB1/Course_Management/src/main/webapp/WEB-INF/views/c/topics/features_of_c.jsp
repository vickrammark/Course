		<p>
			C is the widely used language. It provides many <strong>features</strong>
			that are given below.
		</p>
		<ol class="points">
			<li>Simple</li>
			<li>Machine Independent or Portable</li>
			<li>Mid-level programming language</li>
			<li>structured programming language</li>
			<li>Rich Library</li>
			<li>Memory Management</li>
			<li>Fast Speed</li>
			<li>Pointers</li>
			<li>Recursion</li>
			<li>Extensible</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">1) Simple</h2>
		<p>
			C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a <strong>structured
				approach</strong> (to break the problem into parts), <strong>the
				rich set of library functions</strong>, <strong>data types</strong>, etc.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">2) Machine Independent or Portable</h2>
		<p>
			Unlike assembly language, c programs <strong>can be executed
				on different machines</strong> with some machine specific changes. Therefore,
			C is a machine independent language.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">3) Mid-level programming language</h2>
		<p>
			Although, C is <strong>intended to do low-level programming</strong>.
			It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver,
			etc. It <strong>also supports the features of a high-level
				language</strong>. That is why it is known as mid-level language.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">4) Structured programming language</h2>
		<p>
			C is a structured programming language in the sense that <strong>we
				can break the program into parts using functions</strong>. So, it is easy to
			understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">5) Rich Library</h2>
		<p>
			C <strong>provides a lot of inbuilt functions</strong> that make the
			development fast.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">6) Memory Management</h2>
		<p>
			It supports the feature of <strong>dynamic memory allocation</strong>.
			In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by
			calling the <strong>free()</strong> function.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">7) Speed</h2>
		<p>The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since
			there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">8) Pointer</h2>
		<p>
			C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the
			memory by using the pointers. We <strong>can use pointers
				for memory, structures, functions, array</strong>, etc.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">9) Recursion</h2>
		<p>
			In C, we <strong>can call the function within the function</strong>.
			It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us
			to use the approach of backtracking.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="h3">10) Extensible</h2>
		<p>
			C language is extensible because it <strong>can easily adopt
				new features</strong>.
