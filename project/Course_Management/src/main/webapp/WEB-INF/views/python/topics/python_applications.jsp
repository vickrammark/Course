	<h1 class="h1">Python Applications</h1>
	<p>Python is known for its general-purpose nature that makes it
		applicable in almost every domain of software development. Python
		makes its presence in every emerging field. It is the fastest-growing
		programming language and can develop any application.</p>
	<p>Here, we are specifying application areas where Python can be
		applied.</p>

		alt="Python Applications" />
	<h3 class="h3">1) Web Applications</h3>
	<p>
		We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries
		to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email
		processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. One of Python
		web-framework named Django is used on <strong>Instagram</strong>.
		Python provides many useful frameworks, and these are given below:
	</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>Django and Pyramid framework(Use for heavy applications)</li>
		<li>Flask and Bottle (Micro-framework)</li>
		<li>Plone and Django CMS (Advance Content management)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">2) Desktop GUI Applications</h3>
	<p>
		The GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface, which provides a
		smooth interaction to any application. Python provides a <strong>Tk
			GUI library</strong> to develop a user interface. Some popular GUI libraries
		are given below.
	</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>Tkinter or Tk</li>
		<li>wxWidgetM</li>
		<li>Kivy (used for writing multitouch applications )</li>
		<li>PyQt or Pyside</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">3) Console-based Application</h3>
	<p>
		Console-based applications run from the command-line or shell. These
		applications are computer program which are used commands to execute.
		This kind of application was more popular in the old generation of
		computers. Python can develop this kind of application very
		effectively. It is famous for having REPL, which means <strong>the
			Read-Eval-Print Loop</strong> that makes it the most suitable language for the
		command-line applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		Python provides many free library or module which helps to build the
		command-line apps. The necessary <strong>IO</strong> libraries are
		used to read and write. It helps to parse argument and create console
		help text out-of-the-box. There are also advance libraries that can
		develop independent console apps.
	</p>
	<h3 class="h3">4) Software Development</h3>
	<p>Python is useful for the software development process. It works
		as a support language and can be used to build control and management,
		testing, etc.</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li><strong>SCons</strong> is used to build control.</li>
		<li><strong>Buildbot</strong> and <strong>Apache</strong> Gumps
			are used for automated continuous compilation and testing.
		<li><strong>Round</strong> or <strong>Trac</strong> for bug
			tracking and project management.
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">5) Scientific and Numeric</h3>
	<p>This is the era of Artificial intelligence where the machine can
		perform the task the same as the human. Python language is the most
		suitable language for Artificial intelligence or machine learning. It
		consists of many scientific and mathematical libraries, which makes
		easy to solve complex calculations.</p>
	<p>Implementing machine learning algorithms require complex
		mathematical calculation. Python has many libraries for scientific and
		numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. If you have
		some basic knowledge of Python, you need to import libraries on the
		top of the code. Few popular frameworks of machine libraries are given
		below.</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>SciPy</li>
		<li>Scikit-learn</li>
		<li>NumPy</li>
		<li>Pandas</li>
		<li>Matplotlib</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">6) Business Applications</h3>
	<p>Business Applications differ from standard applications.
		E-commerce and ERP are an example of a business application. This kind
		of application requires extensively, scalability and readability, and
		Python provides all these features.</p>
	<p>
		Oddo is an example of the all-in-one Python-based application which
		offers a range of business applications. Python provides a <strong>Tryton</strong>
		platform which is used to develop the business application.
	</p>
	<h3 class="h3">7) Audio or Video-based Applications</h3>
	<p>
		Python is flexible to perform multiple tasks and can be used to create
		multimedia applications. Some multimedia applications which are made
		by using Python are <strong>TimPlayer, cplay,</strong> etc. The few
		multimedia libraries are given below.
	</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>Gstreamer</li>
		<li>Pyglet</li>
		<li>QT Phonon</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">8) 3D CAD Applications</h3>
	<p>The CAD (Computer-aided design) is used to design engineering
		related architecture. It is used to develop the 3D representation of a
		part of a system. Python can create a 3D CAD application by using the
		following functionalities.</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>Fandango (Popular )</li>
		<li>CAMVOX</li>
		<li>HeeksCNC</li>
		<li>AnyCAD<M li>
			<li>RCAM</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="h3">9) Enterprise Applications</h3>
	<p>Python can be used to create applications that can be used
		within an Enterprise or an Organization. Some real-time applications
		are OpenERP, Tryton, Picalo, etc.</p>
	<h3 class="h3">10) Image Processing Application</h3>
	<p>Python contains many libraries that are used to work with the
		image. The image can be manipulated according to our requirements.
		Some libraries of image processing are given below.</p>
	<ul class="points">
		<li>OpenCV</li>
		<li>Pillow</li>
		<li>SimpleITK</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In this topic, we have described all types of applications where
		Python plays an essential role in the development of these
		applications. In the next tutorial, we will learn more concepts about
		Python.</p>
