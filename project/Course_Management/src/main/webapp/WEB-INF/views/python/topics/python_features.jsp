		<p>Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python.
			Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.</p>
		<p>Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and
			object-oriented programming language.</p>
		<p>
			Python is an interpreted scripting language also. <em>Guido Van
				Rossum</em> is known as the founder of Python programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as
			installation, control statements, <a href="python-strings">Strings</a>,
			<a href="python-lists">Lists</a>, <a href="python-tuples">Tuples</a>,
			<a href="python-dictionary">Dictionary</a>, <a href="python-modules">Modules</a>,
			<a href="python-exception-handling">Exceptions</a>, Date and Time,
			File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview
			questions to help you better understand Python Programming.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">What is Python</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Python</strong> is a general purpose, dynamic, <a
				href="classification-of-programming-languages">high-level</a>, and
			interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented
			programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy
			to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python is <em>easy to learn</em> yet powerful and versatile scripting
			language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python's syntax and <em>dynamic typing</em> with its interpreted
			nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
			development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python supports <em>multiple programming pattern</em>, including
			object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming
			styles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web
			programming. That is why it is known as <em>multipurpose</em>
			programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D
			CAD, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is <em>dynamically
				typed</em> so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer
			variable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Python makes the development and debugging <em>fast</em> because
			there is no compilation step included in Python development, and
			edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Python 2 vs. Python 3</h2>
		<p>In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version
			releases, it supports the features and syntax of the existing version
			of the language, therefore, it is easier for the projects to switch
			in the newer version. However, in the case of Python, the two
			versions Python 2 and Python 3 are very much different from each
			other.</p>
		<p>A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given
			below:</p>
		<ol class="points">
			<li>Python 2 uses <strong>print</strong> as a statement and used
				as print "something" to print some string on the console. On the
				other hand, Python 3 uses <strong>print</strong> as a function and
				used as print("something") to print something on the console.
			</li>
			<li>Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's
				input. It returns the string representing the value, which is typed
				by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the
				int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 uses input()
				function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered
				by the user. However, we can cast this value to any type by using
				primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).</li>
			<li>In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in
				Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.</li>
			<li>Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2.
				The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a
				xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range()
				returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2.
			</li>
			<li>There is also a small change made in Exception handling in
				Python 3. It defines a keyword <strong>as</strong> which is
				necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling
				section of Python programming tutorial.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="h2">Python History</h2>
		<p>
			Python was invented by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in 1991 at
			CWI in Netherland. The idea of Python programming language has taken
			from the ABC programming language or we can say that ABC is a
			predecessor of Python language.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is also a fact behind the choosing name Python. Guido van
			Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, <strong>"Monty
				Python's Flying Circus"</strong>. So he decided to pick the name <strong>Python</strong>
			for his newly created programming language.
		</p>
		<p>Python has the vast community across the world and releases its
			version within the short period.</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Why learn Python?</h2>
		<p>Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These
			features make it most popular and widely used language. We have
			listed below few-essential feature of Python.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li>Easy to use and Learn</li>
			<li>Expressive Language</li>
			<li>Interpreted Language</li>
			<li>Object-Oriented Language</li>
			<li>Open Source Language</li>
			<li>Extensible</li>
			<li>Learn Standard Library</li>
			<li>GUI Programming Support</li>
			<li>Integrated</li>
			<li>Embeddable</li>
			<li>Dynamic Memory Allocation</li>
			<li>Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Where is Python used?</h2>
		<p>Python is a general-purpose, popular programming language and
			it is used in almost every technical field. The various areas of
			Python use are given below.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li>Data Science</li>
			<li>Date Mining</li>
			<li>Desktop Applications</li>
			<li>Console-based Applications</li>
			<li>Mobile Applications</li>
			<li>Software Development</li>
			<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
			<li>Web Applications</li>
			<li>Enterprise Applications</li>
			<li>3D CAD Applications</li>
			<li>Machine Learning</li>
			<li>Computer Vision or Image Processing Applications.</li>
			<li>Speech Recognitions</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Basic Syntax</h2>
		<p>
			There is no use of curly braces or semicolon in Python programming
			language. It is English-like language. But Python uses the
			indentation to define a block of code. Indentation is nothing but
			adding whitespace before the statement when it is needed. <strong>For
				example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
def func():
       statement 1
       statement 2
       &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
       &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
         statement N
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>In the above example, the statements that are same level to
			right belong to the function. Generally, we can use four whitespaces
			to define indentation.</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Python First Program</h2>
		<p>
			Unlike the other programming languages, Python provides the facility
			to execute the code using few lines. <strong>For example</strong> -
			Suppose we want to print the <strong>"Hello World"</strong> program
			in Java; it will take three lines to print it.
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
public class HelloWorld {
 public static void main(String[] args){
// Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
  System.out.println("Hello World");
 }
 }
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>On the other hand, we can do this using one statement in
			Python.</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
print("Hello World")
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>Both programs will print the same result, but it takes only one
			statement without using a semicolon or curly braces in Python.</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Popular Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
		<p>Python has wide range of libraries and frameworks widely used
			in various fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence,
			web applications, etc. We define some popular frameworks and
			libraries of Python as follows.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Web development (Server-side) -</strong> Django
				Flask, Pyramid, CherryPy</li>
			<li><strong>GUIs based applications -</strong> Tk, PyGTK, PyQt,
				PyJs, etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Machine Learning -</strong> TensorFlow, PyTorch, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>,
				Matplotlib, Scipy, etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Mathematics -</strong> Numpy, Pandas, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python print() Function</h2>
		<p>
			The <strong>print()</strong> function displays the given object to
			the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike the other programming languages, Python <strong>print()</strong>
			function is most unique and versatile function.
		</p>
		<p>
			The syntax of <strong>print()</strong> function is given below.
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>Let's explain its parameters one by one.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>objects -</strong> An object is nothing but a
				statement that to be printed. The * sign represents that there can
				be multiple statements.</li>
			<li><strong>sep -</strong> The <strong>sep</strong> parameter
				separates the print values. Default values is ' '.</li>
			<li><strong>end -</strong> The <strong>end</strong> is printed
				at last in the statement.</li>
			<li><strong>file -</strong> It must be an object with a
				write(string) method.</li>
			<li><strong>flush -</strong> The stream or file is forcibly
				flushed if it is true. By default, its value is false.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let's understand the following example.</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Example - 1: Return a value</h3>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
print("Welcome to javaTpoint.")

a = 10
# Two objects are passed in print() function
print("a =", a)

b = a
# Three objects are passed in print function
print('a =', a, '= b')
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>Welcome to javaTpoint.
a = 10
a = 10 = b
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			As we can see in the above output, the multiple objects can be
			printed in the single <strong>print()</strong> statement. We just
			need to use comma (,) to separate with each other.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Example - 2: Using sep and end argument</h3>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
a = 10
print("a =", a, sep='dddd', end='\n\n\n')
print("a =", a, sep='0', end='$$$$$')
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>a =dddd10


a =010$$$$$
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			In the first <strong>print()</strong> statement, we use the <strong>sep</strong>
			and <strong>end</strong> arguments. The given object is printed just
			after the <strong>sep</strong> values. The value of end parameter
			printed at the last of given object. As we can see that, the second <strong>print()</strong>
			function printed the result after the three black lines.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Taking Input to the User</h2>
		<p>
			Python provides the <strong>input()</strong> function which is used
			to take input from the user. Let's understand the following example.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
name = input("Enter a name of student:")
print("The student name is: ", name)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>Enter a name of student: Devansh
The student name is:   Devansh
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			By default, the <strong>input()</strong> function takes the string
			input but what if we want to take other data types as an input.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we want to take input as an integer number, we need to typecast
			the <strong>input()</strong> function into an integer.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>For example -</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
a  = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print(a+b)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>Enter first number: 50
Enter second number: 100
150
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			We can take any type of values using <strong>input()</strong>
			function.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Operators</h2>
		<p>Operators are the symbols which perform various operations on
			Python objects. Python operators are the most essential to work with
			the Python data types. In addition, Python also provides identify
			membership and bitwise operators. We will learn all these operators
			with the suitable example in following tutorial.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Operators</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Conditional Statements</h2>
		<p>Conditional statements help us to execute a particular block
			for a particular condition. In this tutorial, we will learn how to
			use the conditional expression to execute a different block of
			statements. Python provides if and else keywords to set up logical
			conditions. The elif keyword is also used as conditional statement.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python if..else statement</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Loops</h2>
		<p>Sometimes we may need to alter the flow of the program. The
			execution of a specific code may need to be repeated several numbers
			of times. For this purpose, the programming languages provide various
			types of loops capable of repeating some specific code several times.
			Consider the following tutorial to understand the statements in
			detail.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Loops</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Python For Loop</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Python While Loop</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Data Structures</h2>
		<p>
			Data structures are referred which can hold some data together or we
			say that they are used to store the data in organized way. Python
			provides built-in data structures such as <strong>list,
				tuple, dictionary, and set</strong>. We can perform complex tasks using data
			structures.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Python List</h3>
		<p>Python list holds the ordered collection of items. We can store
			a sequence of items in a list. Python list is mutable which means it
			can be modified after its creation. The items of lists are enclosed
			within the square bracket [] and separated by the comma. Let's see
			the example of list.</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
L1 = ["John", 102, "USA"]    
L2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]   
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			If we try to print the type of L1, L2, and L3 using <strong>type()</strong>
			function then it will come out to be a list.
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
print(type(L1))  
print(type(L2))  
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>&lt;class 'list'&gt;
&lt;class 'list'&gt;
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>To learn more about list, visit the following tutorial.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python List</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Python List Functions</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="h3">Python Tuple</h3>
		<p>Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python
			objects. The tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items
			stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable,
			and the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed.</p>
		<p>Tuple can be defined as follows</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
tup = ("Apple", "Mango" , "Orange" , "Banana")
print(type(tup))
print(tup)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
('Apple', 'Mango', 'Orange', 'Banana')
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>If we try to add new to the tuple, it will throw an error.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
tup = ("Apple", "Mango" , "Orange" , "Banana")

tup[2] = "Papaya"
print(tup)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/DEVANSH SHARMA/PycharmProjects/Hello/gamewithturtle.py", line 3, in <module>
    tup[2] = "Papaya"
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

		
			</pre>
		</div>
		<p>The above program throws an error because tuples are immutable
			type. To learn more about tuple, visit the Python Tuples.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Tuple</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="h3">Python String</h3>
		<p>Python string is a sequence of characters. It is a collection
			of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or
			triple quotes. It can also define as collection of the Unicode
			characters. We can create a string as follows.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
# Creating string using double quotes
str1 = "Hi Python"
print(str1)
# Creating string using single quotes
str1 = 'Hi Python'
print(str1)
# Creating string using triple quotes
str1 = '''Hi Python'''
print(str1)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>Hi Python
Hi Python
Hi Python
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>Python doesn't support the character data-type. A single
			character written as 'p' is treated as a string of length 1.</p>
		<p>Stings are also immutable. We can't change after it is
			declared. To learn more about the string, visit the following
			tutorial.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Strings</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Python String Method</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="h3">Dictionaries</h3>
		<p>Python Dictionary is a most efficient data structure and used
			to store the large amount of data. It stores the data in the
			key-value pair format. Each value is stored corresponding to its key.</p>
		<p>Keys must be a unique and value can be any type such as
			integer, list, tuple, etc.</p>
		<p>It is a mutable type; we can reassign after its creation. Below
			is the example of creating dictionary in Python.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
employee = {"Name": "John", "Age": 29, "salary":250000,"Company":"GOOGLE"}    
print(type(employee))    
print("printing Employee data .... ")    
print(employee)
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>&lt;class 'dict'&gt;
Printing Employee data .... 
{'Name': 'John', 'Age': 29, 'salary': 250000, 'Company': 'GOOGLE'}
</pre>
		</div>
		<p>The empty curly braces {} are used to create empty dictionary.
			To learn more, visit the complete tutorial of the dictionary.</p>

			<li><strong>Python Dictionary Methods</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="h3">Python Sets</h3>
		<p>A Python set is a collection of unordered elements. Each
			element in set must be unique and immutable. Sets are mutable which
			means we can modify anytime throughout the program. Let's understand
			the example of creating set in Python.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Example -</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<textarea name="code" class="java">
# Creating Set
Month = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"}
print(Month)
print(type(Month))
</textarea>
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong>Output:</strong>
		</p>
		<div class="codeblock3">
			<pre>{'March', 'July', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'February', 'January'}
&lt;class 'set'&gt;
</pre>
		</div>

		<h2 class="h2">Python Functional Programming</h2>
		<p>
			This section of Python tutorial defines some important tools related
			to functional programming such as <strong>lambda and
				recursive functions</strong>. These functions are very efficient in
			accomplishing the complex tasks. We define a few important functions,
			such as <strong>reduce, map,</strong> and <strong>filter.</strong>
			Python provides the <strong>functools</strong> module that includes
			various <strong>functional programming tools</strong>. Visit the
			following tutorial to learn more about functional programming.
		</p>
		<ul class="points">

			<li>Python filter() Function</li>
			<li>Python reduce() Function</li>
			<li>Python functool Module</li>
			<li>Python Lambda Function</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python File I/O</h2>
		<p>Files are used to store data in a computer disk. In this
			tutorial, we explain the built-in file object of Python. We can open
			a file using Python script and perform various operations such as
			writing, reading, and appending. There are various ways of opening a
			file. We are explained with the relevant example. We will also learn
			to perform read/write operations on binary files.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python File I/O</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Modules</h2>
		<p>
			Python modules are the program files that contain a Python code or
			functions. There are two types of module in the Python - User-define
			modules and built-in modules. A module that the user defines, or we
			can say that our Python code saved with <strong>.py</strong>
			extension, is treated as a user-define module.
		</p>
		<p>Built-in modules are predefined modules of Python. To use the
			functionality of the modules, we need to import them into our current
			working program.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Modules</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Exceptions</h2>
		<p>An exception can be defined as an unusual condition in a
			program resulting in the interruption in the flow of the program.</p>
		<p>Whenever an exception occurs, the program stops the execution,
			and thus the further code is not executed. Therefore, an exception is
			the run-time errors that are unable to handle to Python script. An
			exception is a Python object that represents an error.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Exceptions</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python CSV</h2>
		<p>
			A <strong>csv</strong> stands for "comma separated values", which is
			defined as a simple file format that uses specific structuring to
			arrange tabular data. It stores tabular data such as spreadsheet or
			database in plain text and has a common format for data interchange.
			A <strong>csv</strong> file opens into the excel sheet, and the rows
			and columns data define the standard format. Visit the following
			tutorial to learn the CSV module in detail.

		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Read CSV File</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Python Write CSV File</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Sending Mail</h2>
		<p>We can send or read a mail using the Python script. Python's
			standard library modules are useful for handling various protocols
			such as PoP3 and IMAP. We will learn how to send a mail with the
			popular email service SMTP from a Python script.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Python Sending Emails</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="h2">Python Magic Methods</h2>
		<p>
			Python magic method is defined as the special method which adds
			"magic" to a class. It starts and ends with double underscores, for
			example, <strong>_init_</strong> or <strong>_str_.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The built-in classes define many magic methods. The <strong>dir()</strong>
			function can be used to see the number of magic methods inherited by
			a class. It has two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method
			name.

		<h2 class="h2">Python Oops Concepts</h2>
		<p>Everything in Python is treated as an object including integer
			values, floats, functions, classes, and none. Apart from that, Python
			supports all oriented concepts. Below is the brief introduction of
			oops concepts of Python.</p>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><strong>Classes and Objects -</strong> Python classes are
				the blueprint of the object. An object is a collection of data and
				method that act on the data.</li>
			<li><strong>Inheritance -</strong> An inheritance is a technique
				where one class inherits the properties of other classes.</li>
			<li><strong>Constructor -</strong> Python provides a special
				method <strong>__init__()</strong> which is known as a constructor.
				This method is automatically called when an object is instantiated.</li>
